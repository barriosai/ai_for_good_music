Let's explore how we can represent musical notes as strings and rhythms as numbers in Python. Strings are a kind of data type, it's a string of characters, per say. For example, the letter \"C\" is a single character but its still s string and we can store it in a variable \"note\". There are rules for variable name and we'll get to those later."
